# CTF Archive

This is just an archive of all the CTF challenges I have written for various CTFs, mostly for myself.

The folders are organized by CTF, then by challenge. 

Inside the challenge, there will be a src/ directory with all the source files. The public files are in the public/ directory.

Most challenges will have a solve script attached in the root directory of the challenge, but only a few will have actual writeups if any.

p.s. difficulties are very subjective and are often based of the difficulty of the CTF itself. feel free to ignore them if you feel like it.
